Note, it is unliley that you will find this file useful, unless you happen to have similar
architecture: .so files are not necessary compatible between MacOS and Linux/Unix users.

Also note this was built for use in a Python2 environment, and it is most likely you will
be using Python3.

Nonetheless, it is included for those having similar hardware. If you have a Intel MacOS and
will be using Python2, this should work for you. Else, follow instructions on the homepage
to compile your own .so file.
